# Training vs. Learning

Although people often say they *train* an AI, the focus too often lies on the notion of *Intelligence*, but the label of *traning* or *learning* (such as in *learning rate*) gets overlooked.

## Training piano

Training a piano describes the communication of piano and a person.
This is a two way communication as a player tries to tell the piano what to do but also.
The result is that the piano can be together with a player form a new way.

One could therefore believe that a piano is a rather passive actor as it needs some excitation or impulse in order to react, but is this true?
A piano has its own {term}`agency`, but {cite}`born2018`.

## Player Piano as an abstraction

Acoustic instruments rely on an immediate impulse in form of a physical excitement which will be transformed into sound.
This exciting can be the plucking of a string, the blowing of a pipe, or the striking of an object.

This impulse can still be amplified through mechanical means such as on a church organ or through electronic means in case of an electric guitar.

The introduction of piano rolls for player pianos allowed to create a separation between a human exciting an instrument and a sound can be heard, therefore creating a first abstraction of sound through piano rolls, which contrary to traditional scores do not rely on an execution of a player anymore.

The piano roll has some similarities with a punch card programming as it allows to store information in form of a sequence of instructions which are used to set the controls for a system with multiple possible outcomes.

This system evolved into {term}`MIDI` after some time.

## Agency of the player piano

A piano automata has often 

There are some really interesting pieces for player piano, which should only give an introduction.

### Conlon Nancarrow - Studies for player piano

The works of Nancarrow influenced 

### Peter Ablinger & Winfried Ritsch - Speaking piano

Austrian composers Peter Ablinger created a famous piece entitled [*Deus Cantando*](https://ablinger.mur.at/txt_qu3god.html) which makes use of the [*Speaking Piano*](https://ablinger.mur.at/speaking_piano.html) which was build by Winfried Ritsch.

Ablinger [writes](https://ablinger.mur.at/speaking_piano.html) about the speaking piano
 
> Talking machines have been in conversation since 1748. Leonhard Euler, for example, had the idea of constructing a piano who's individual keys would produce each a speech sound (cf. Mladen Dolar, The Voice of His Master, p. 13ff). In 1780 the Imperial Academy of Sciences in Saint Petersburg announced an award to build a talking machine. Christian Gottlieb Kratzenstein wins the award.
> 
> 1748-1780: This is the heyday of the development and emancipation of sonata and instrumental music. And of course, instrumental music is itself a speaking machine. After all, it had to speak to us. It had to tell us something! Only on this condition could the newly emerging instrumental music finally be accepted. And the sonata is nothing more than a speech that tries to convince us, and which we judge according to how convincing we find it.
> 
> But the history of instrumental music and speaking machines is also the history of information technology. Because when Graham Bell saw the speaking machine, he wanted to recreate something similar but in the process inadvertently invented the telephone; at the same time Charles Babbage invented the first calculating machine in 1819, also in response to a speaking automaton.
> 
> Talking machines, sonatas and computers - or smartphones - are on the same line.

### George Lewis - Voyager

Instead of providing a static piece which has a fixed state, Lewis created a system which allows for interaction with a player.

## Training a piano to play

Practicing an instrument covers the control of an instrument in a physical but also psychological manner, as it is necessary to introduce.

Having the ability to access a piano.

The physical training of a piano is included in the mechanical abilities of the player piano.

But even once a neural network has been trained and is operating, there is still the action to attach it to a piano, therefore while the physical training may not be necessary anymore to get this machine running, it also involves the action to decide what possibilities should be allowed and which excluded.
