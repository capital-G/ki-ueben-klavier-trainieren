# The artificial

We reflect upon the artifical, which itself is already a reflection as we will see.

The melange of our own perception and something *artifical*, seemingly outside of ourselves, gets more and more entangled and provides opportunity to learn something new about ourselves through reflection of these situonios.


## The reflection of ourselves

```{epigraph}
Cogito ergo sum

--- René Descartes
```

When thinking about our*selves*, it is important to reflect what we actually perceive as ourselves.
The perception of oneself is an action of the second order, such as *recognizing* oneself can only be achieved through the observation of being oneself, therefore we have an encapsulation of ourselves when observing ourselves.
And while we have a physical attachment to *ourselves* through our body, we don't have a physical attachment on the action of observation.

We therefore consider something artificial which is based upon a physical structure, but operates on itself through the physical structure.

## Enjoyment of the 2nd order

```{epigraph}
How are we to cope with this brave new world which undermines the basic premises of our intimate life? The ultimate solution would be, of course, to push a vibrator into the Stamina Training Unit, turn them both on and leave all the fun to this ideal couple, with us, the two real human partners, sitting at a nearby table, drinking tea and calmly enjoying the fact that, without great effort, we have fulfilled our duty to enjoy.

The concept ob observing someone acts in a similar manner - through a seemingly passive action of observing an action we reflect upon it and can feel the joy of playing a game without the action of playing a game - it becomes the ultimate apparatus of fulfilling joy.

## Face swapping

*Artificial intelligence* maybe often used to create a more artificial version of ourselves.

## Live of an NPC

Recently there has been has been an [advent of the concept *NPC*](https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/npc-non-playable-character), which stands for Non-Playable-Character.

It rose popularity through memes and became more and more mainstream in such a way, that it was even picked up as [candidate for the 2023 edition of the *Jugendwort des Jahres*](https://www.langenscheidt.com/presse/jugendwort-2023-das-sind-die-top-10) by Langenscheidt Verlag.

### Reversing an NPC

I really don't know what to write here.

Maybe it is good to try to explain what I want to do here.

### The audience vs. the performer

Through the actions of a player piano, the player can also become the audience of their own playing.

It is not the same as a sonic recoding of a performance as the reconstruction of the player piano allows to synchronize it to the same acoustics and physical movement applied upon the piano - it is also a simulation of perceiving, it is in the same state that we are in during all times, the second order observation.

So what else is there to do? Is there something we need to do? Is there something we should do?

## How does this belong together

The similarities of training an AI and training on a piano - both try to follow an ideal target which does not exist in reality and try to approximate it through repetition, evaluation and adaptation - in an endless cycle.

There is also a perspective of mirroring something - normally this is done through a record, but on a player piano it is possible to.

At the same time, having the connection to *something a human could do* gives the very reason to perform something on it, which a human could not do - most likely by doing something faster or *more of it* at the same time.

So what is the reason to not have this anymore?

There is a theory that a reflection is necessary in order to obtain knowledge - sentience creates the ability to reflect upon oneself, stepping outside of oneself and reflect.
Without this second order action of observing it would be impossible for us to adapt the situation, but we trade this in for staying in this second order perspective forever - we even tend to separate from our experience before this situation, which is the reason why we can not remember anything from post-natality.
It needs lots of practice to realize that oneself is in this situation.



## The audience vs. the performer

The question of the relating to the action through observation enables a way of *Entfremdung* with ourselves.

Maybe this has also become so big because todays media consumption is driven by

The vastness of todays commentary create a plurality which is about contradicting each other, which allows to amplify itself.

This contradicts a more unifying approach within the academia which does not  mean that within this domain there are no contradictions or, yet within this domain it has been decided to accept the voice of reason as a referee about conflicts, and arguing is ideally aimed at specifics and not on individuals or with the motivation to create an uproar.

Therefore, the observing of the observing maybe adds a needed curation of the multitudes of content.
Instead of watching everything by ones own, the community decides to let the person curate the playlist, so what a DJ is to the dancefloor, a reaction video producer or streamer is a curator of the user generated content.

### Musical performance

On a musical performance, the act of observing is something different though, because the actual action of playing an instrument is something which requires skill, and often enough people within a concert want to observe this skill instead of the actual music which will be performed.

In classical settings, the display of skill is always visible during the performance.

### The player piano as a performer

When shifting into a setup where the show of skill is not directly visible anymore, the audience can solely focus on the music.
But this is most likely not what the audience wants?
The audience wants something to relate to - electronic sounds are not embodied through the human body, therefore still something, outside, strange and unknown, and seeing someone who interacts with an abstract instrument[^abstract_instrument]

With the help of a player piano this shifts again - although the technical setup of performing a piece for player piano is a delicate operation, the

### The player piano vs. AI

How does this relate to AI?

[^abstract_instrument]: An abstract instrument is defined as an object, through which interaction can generate sound. But opposing to classical instruments, the physical interaction will not be directly translated into sound (the press of a piano key correlates with the sound of the piano string), but instead allows to construct, delay or combine multiple (musical and non-musical) events via physical interaction (the press of a key on a computer keyboard to type in a statement such as `STOP ALL SOUNDS`).
