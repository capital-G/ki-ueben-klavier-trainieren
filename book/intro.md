# KI üben, Klavier trainieren

Welcome to the project page of *KI üben, Klavier trainieren* (german for *Practicing AI, training piano*) which is a project of the [digi-Fellows](https://www.dh.nrw/kooperationen/Digi-Fellows-2) program of the state North Rhine-Westphalia.

The aim of this project is to dissects the the artistic and technical development when contrasting the learning of a person on a piano and the training of a neural network.
Is it possible to reflect upon ones own training on a piano by looking how a digital counterpart tackles advancements?
How does this  dexterity translate to the mechanical abstractions of a player piano?

To achieve this, the course will not just demonstrate how to implement, train and use learnable algorithms but also reflect about notions of artificiality and art, artist and computer, by providing technical, artistic and philosophical background for discussion.

At the same time, the course tries to explore the possibilities of an online course  by using [Jupyter Book](https://jupyterbook.org/).
The question here is how to reach and interact with an audience beyond the barriers of a university, making course material more persistent across time as well as getting into a dialog between audiences - so any feedback or pull request is welcome.


The course is tries to target two kinds of audiences:

* People who have a background in artistic fields and want to get in touch with machine learning without relying on pre-given products
* People who have a background in machine learning but want to pursue and reflect upon its creative potential beyond prompting
