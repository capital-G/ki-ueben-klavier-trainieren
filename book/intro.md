# KI üben, Klavier trainieren

Welcome to the project page of *KI üben, Klavier trainieren* (german for *Practicing AI, training piano*) which is a project of the [digi-Fellows](https://www.dh.nrw/kooperationen/Digi-Fellows-2) program of the state North Rhine-Westphalia.

The aim of this project is to create a course which dissects the the artistic and technical development of a project which tries to contrast the leraning of a person on a piano and the training of a neural network by training a neural network to play a player piano based on material that students practiced on this piano.
At the same time, by using [Jupyter Book](https://jupyterbook.org/) the course tries to explore the possibilities of an online course for future endeavours by increasing the scope of the audience beyond the bariers of the university, making course material more persistent across time as well as getting into a dialoge between audiences - so any feedback or pull request is welcome.

The goal of the course is to document the steps towards creating an artwork which reflects upon the juxtaposition of learning of machines and training of humans on a player piano.
