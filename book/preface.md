# Preface

## Audience

Although the course discusses advanced topics in media theory, engineering and artistic work it is targeted at everyone who is interested in these topics.

Beneath an understanding and reflection of exercising an musical instrument (or any other instrument) there is also an interest in technical aspects such as programming or project work

The course is aimed to be worked on as a group during, for example a seminar, as well as for self study.

## Python

Python is a general purpose language which is easy to pick up and has a variety of tools in its pocket, which covers the creation of small scripts for automation as well as controlling the computation of neural networks across an array of GPUs.

## SuperCollider

Python is a great general purpose language, yet it often makes sense to focus on one specific aspect and design a programming language around it.
SuperCollider is a framework for audio synthesis and contains the programming language {term}`sclang` which is specifically designed around the needs of realtime audio and interaction with realtime processes, which allows to include.

## Hardware

As the course also dives into training of neural networks it is necessary to also have access to such a GPU in order to train ones own model.

If such a hardware is not available it is not a problem as all trained models will be published.

Although the project will target a player piano in the end, it is also possible to do this at home with any virtual instrument (VST) or any polyphonic MIDI sound generator.
