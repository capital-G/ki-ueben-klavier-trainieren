# Preface

## Audience

Although the course discusses advanced topics in media theory, engineering, and artistic work, it is intended for anyone interested in these topics.

In addition to understanding and reflecting on the practice of a musical instrument (or any other instrument), there is also an interest in technical aspects such as programming or project work.

The course is intended to be worked on in a group, e.g. during a seminar, as well as for self-study by providing topics for discussion as well as providing further references to be explored.

## Hardware

Since the course also deals with the training of neural networks, it is advised to have access to a GPU if one is interested in training a model by oneself on custom data.

If one does not have hardware, this is not a problem, as all trained models will be published.

Although the project is aimed towards the *Steinway spirio r* player piano, it is also possible to do this with any other MIDI capable player piano or use of a virtual piano (via e.g. VST) and a MIDI keyboard at home.
