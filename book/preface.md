# Preface

## Audience

Although the course discusses advanced topics in media theory, engineering, and artistic work, it is intended for anyone interested in these topics.

In addition to understanding and reflecting on the practice of a musical instrument (or any other instrument), there is also an interest in technical aspects such as programming or project work.

The course is intended to be worked on in a group, e.g. during a seminar, as well as for self-study.

## Hardware

Since the course also deals with the training of neural networks, it is necessary to have access to a GPU in order to train your own model.

If you do not have such hardware, this is not a problem, as all trained models will be published.

Although the project is aimed at a player piano, it is also possible to do this at home with any virtual instrument (VST) or any polyphonic MIDI sound generator.
